I am a Solution Architect at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/) focused on AI/ML, specifically distributed training. My background is in High-Performance and Scientific Computing. I joined Amazon in 2017 and I helped build and launch [AWS ParallelCluster](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster), an open-source product to build High-Performance computing clusters. I then built out [ParallelCluster Manager](https://pcluster.cloud) (now called ParallelCluster UI), a web-console for ParallelCluster. I'm a [Pilot and a Flight Instructor (CFI, CFII)](#aviation-). I own two airplanes and have [flown to all 50 US States](#50-states-) to raise money for Angel Flight West. I run long distances and regularly run [100 miles at a time](#running-). In college I gave the [graduation speech](#college-) for the CS department and graduated in four years with a bachelor and masters degree.

## Aviation ✈️

I started flying in 2017 and since I've accumulated well over 1,000 hours of total flight time in airplanes ranging from seaplanes to speedy, modern retractable-gear aircraft. I own a 1947 Cessna 140 [N3701V](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N3701V) and a 1969 Mooney M20k [N231ER](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N231ER). I'm an FAA rated Flight Instructor (CFI) and instrument flight instructor (CFII). I taught my fiancé Alex how to fly and now she's an active pilot. You can learn to [fly with me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCqnzM-LuqA&t=1s) ✈️

## 50 States 🇺🇸

In 2022, I flew to all 50 States in order to raise money for Angel Flight West. Angel Flight provides transport (via aircraft) for patients with critical medical attention. This provides a vital link for patients in rural communities to easily get medical care from far away hospitals.

The trip took 31 days and in addition to landing in each state we also ran a mile in each state. Read more about it [@ thefiftyproject.com](https://thefiftyproject.com/).

## Running 🏃🏻‍♂️

I'm an avid runner, I completed my first marathon at age 15 and haven't stopped running since. I've completed numerous ultra-marathon races including Canyons 100M, Oregon Cascades 100M, [UTMB](https://montblanc.utmb.world/races/UTMB) and a bunch of shorter races. My current goal is to qualify for Hardrock 100 or Western States.
