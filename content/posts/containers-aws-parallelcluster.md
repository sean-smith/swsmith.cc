## What are containers?

Containers are a great way to package software, they wrap the runtime of the software up with the application's code. This allows you to pull down optimized software containers and run them out of the box without all the complications of compiling them for a new system. In this blog we'll focus on the [nvidia container repository (ngc)](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers) since they have optimized containers for applications like [gromacs](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/hpc/containers/gromacs), [nemo](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo), and [BERT](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo_bert_text_classification).

## Containers in HPC

> What are the issues with using docker containers in traditional HPC clusters?

Containers typically require a privileged runtime, i.e. the person invoking the container needs sudo access. This is a problem for HPC clusters which are typically multi-user environments with POSIX file permissions used to give access to certain files and directories based on users and groups.

To solve this Nvidia published [enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) - this uses the linux kernel feature [chroot(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) to create an isolated runtime environment for the container. Think of this like creating a mount point `/tmp/container` in which the container can only see it's local directory i.e. `container/`. This serves to separate the outside OS from the container's runtime. Here's an example of enroot in action:

```bash
# Import and start an Amazon Linux image from DockerHub
$ enroot import docker://amazonlinux:latest
$ enroot create amazonlinux+latest.sqsh
$ enroot start amazonlinux+latest
```

In the above example we imported a container from dockerhub, converted it to an enroot container with `enroot create` and then ran it with `enroot start`.

> So how do you schedule and run containers with Slurm?

Slurm provides a [container capability](https://slurm.schedmd.com/containers.html) for OCI containers that's imho pretty awful. It requires users to pull down their container images, convert them to an OCI runtime, then point slurm at that OCI image. To solve this, Nvidia introduced [Pyxis](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pyxis) which is a plugin for Slurm that allows you to run containers using the native OCI runtime capabilities and only specifying the container uri, i.e. `amazonlinux/latest`. An example of this is like so:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --container-image nvcr.io\#nvidia/pytorch:21.12-py3

python -c 'import torch ; print(torch.__version__)'
```

Pretty cool right?

## Containers on ParallelCluster

> So how do we set this all up with AWS ParallelCluster?

To set this up with AWS ParallelCluster we're first going to setup the cluster with a [managed post-install script](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-parallelcluster-post-install-scripts/tree/main/pyxis) that installs pyxis and enroot and another script that installs docker.

1. Create a cluster with the following post-install script on both the Head Node and Compute Nodes. In the below examples we'll use the [cuda:11.6.2](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda) which requires a GPU-based instance like the [g4dn](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) or [g5](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/).

```yaml
 CustomActions:
    OnNodeConfigured:
      Script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-parallelcluster-post-install-scripts/main/multi-runner/postinstall.sh
      Args:
        - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-parallelcluster-post-install-scripts/main/pyxis/postinstall.sh
        - -/fsx
        - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-parallelcluster-post-install-scripts/main/docker/postinstall.sh
```

2. After the cluster creates or updates, SSH into the Head Node. We can test that pyxis and enroot installed correctly by running the [cuda:11.6.2](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda) ubuntu image:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-28-27 ~]$ srun --container-image=nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi
pyxis: importing docker image: nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04
pyxis: imported docker image: nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04

```

3. This can also be run in a sbatch script like so. Think of this as the equivalent of `docker run nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi` on the compute node.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --container-image=nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04

nvidia-smi
```
