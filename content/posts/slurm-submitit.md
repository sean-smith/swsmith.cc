Let's say you want to simplify the job of submitting to a Slurm based cluster. You want to provide users with a simple python interface to submit their ml jobs without having to worry about slurm knowledge.

Enter [submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/tree/main), a tool built by Meta so their ML engineers could easily test distributed ml code without having to learn too much Slurm.
