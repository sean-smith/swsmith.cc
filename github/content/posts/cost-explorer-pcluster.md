# Cost Explorer with AWS ParallelCluster

Budgets allow you to track cost at the per-cluster basis, they do this by tracking tags applied automatically to EC2 Instances launched with pcluster.

This gives users a view of exactly how much a cluster costs overtime, it tracks:

* EC2 Instances
* EBS Volumes
* ~FSx Lustre Volumes~
* ~EFS Volumes~

1. Activate the `parallelcluster:cluster-name` tag in the [Billing Dashboard > Cost Allocation Tags](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/tags)

### Wait 24 hours ðŸ“† ðŸ¥±

2. Then go to [Cost Explorer](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home?#/custom?) > Click on **Tags** on the right side and select `parallelcluster:cluster-name` and the cluster you wish to display the cost of. If you don't see the tag, it's most likely since it hasn't been 24 hours since you activated it ðŸ¥±.

You can group by **Instance Type** to breakdown cost by instance type, you can group by **Service** to break down costs between EC2, EBS, ect.
